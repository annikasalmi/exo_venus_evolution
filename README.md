The goal is to make it extensible to exo-Venus like planets.

rationale:

Models developed for Venus can provide valuable insights into understanding exo-Venuses (Way et al., 2023). We propose to investigate the habitability of these exo-Venuses by applying the Planetary Atmosphere, Crust, and MANtle (PACMAN) model developed by Krissansen-Totton et al. in 2021 with the collected data from the NASA exoplanets dataset, as well as any other additional data gained from JWST or PLATO. This model is ideal for our study as it is capable of incorporating variables such as mass, radius, and volatile composition derived from exoplanet observations, and is publicly available on GitHub.

The coupled model PACMAN investigates the habitability history of Venus from post-accretion magma to the present by observation of modern atmospheric composition and surface condition. It considers the interior and surface evolution by tracking carbon-, hydrogen-, and oxygen-bearing volatiles, along with surface climate dynamics, to investigate the possibility of liquid surface water throughout geological history. Exoplanet properties that could be put into the model include the planet’s mass, radius, and observed volatiles, as well as known properties about the star. 

Based on the similarities between exo-Venuses and Venus, the postdoctoral researcher will adapt the PACMAN model to evaluate the habitability of these exoplanets. Initially, the researcher will adapt the model to account for incomplete exoplanet datasets and validate its performance using currently available data on exo-Venuses(Angelo et al., 2017; Quirino et al., 2023). As new observations become available from upcoming missions, we will refine the model to improve its accuracy. By integrating these observational data with parameter constraints derived from Venus, we will perform Monte Carlo simulations for uncertain parameters and evaluate the potential for surface water on exo-Venuses (read more about the Monte Carlo method in astrophysics in Hénon 1971). The results therefore show how the exo-Venus may have behaved over time across multiple parameters, including potentially whether surface liquid water existed.

Gliese 12b represents a Venus-like exoplanet with atmospheric and physical characteristics suitable for applying the PACMAN model, showcasing its versatility and potential insights. Gliese 12b is an Earth- and Venus-sized exoplanet. Observations show a thick, Venus-sized atmosphere (Dholakia et al.). Then, the researcher could place properties such as the mass and radius of Gliese-12b, observed atmosphere volatiles, and the star Gliese 12 into PACMAN. This will result in a detailed historical model of Gliese 12b over time.

The outcome of this study will be a comprehensive list of identified exo-Venuses with key properties like mass, radius, and atmospheric composition, along with modelling results assessing their potential for surface liquid water from the past to the present. This will address critical knowledge gaps in the habitability assessment of exo-Venuses, contributing to a deeper understanding of exoplanetary habitability and supporting the ongoing search for life in the universe.
